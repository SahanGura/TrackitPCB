   ADVICE: If you DON'T LIKE the result:
    Do another orcadwrite run using one of the following sets of OrCAD writer options:
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.15000 inch(s), 'Grid'=15000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.07500 inch(s), 'Grid'=7500 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.05000 inch(s), 'Grid'=5000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.03750 inch(s), 'Grid'=3750 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
        'Min pin to pin spacing'=0.03000 inch(s), 'Grid'=3000 design unit(s), 
             results in 0 hotspots out of grid
